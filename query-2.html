        <p>Violet Hatpin does not keep an organised database; it's truly a miracle she even managed to set one up. The
            structure on this is particularly iffy, but luckily it doesn't look like she has many records in it. Maybe
            we should just return all the records?</p>

        <p>Good job on that first query. For this one, we need to return all the records in the database. The first thing to consider is that not all queries need a <code>WHERE</code> clause - you only need it if you want to refine the data being returned.</p>
        <p>Secondly, if you'd like to return all the columns, you don't have to waste time typing out all the column names. Just use <code>*</code> in their place instead.</p>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p>To select the all the records in our <code>groceries</code> table, we'd use the following syntax.</p>
        <code>SELECT * FROM groceries;</code>
